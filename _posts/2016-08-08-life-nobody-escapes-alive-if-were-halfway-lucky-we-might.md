  Life. Nobody escapes alive. If we’re halfway lucky we might get 83 summers in
  a lifetime. It sounds long but it’s short, and there’s no reboot. So, choose
  wisely… What floats our respective boats is different for everyone. 83summers
  is about combing your own rewarding inputs, be what they may, and – like a
  sculptor – distilling them down to the essence of what really matters to you,
  shaping each day to be the best it can be. For you.
